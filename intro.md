# Alex Do's Digital Portfolio

Check out the content pages bundled with this sample book to see more.

This book is built off the Jupyter Book [sample](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/start/your-first-book.html).
It shows off a few of the major file types, skills learned in the [UBC Extended Learning Data Science Toolbox course](https://extendedlearning.ubc.ca/courses/data-science-toolbox/0104), and of course Alex Do's impressive portfolio.

````{tab-set}
```{tab-item} Things I learned
I learned about appropriately nesting folders and content.

I learned how to modify the ipynb file in a text editor to redirect 'conda-base-py' to 'python' (I would have been too nervous to muss about in the raw text).
```
```{tab-item} Things I found difficult
Typos in the instructions/modules (e.g., 'nameref' vs 'numref').

Splicing together info from multiple sources (though the internet is great for finding answers to your problems).
